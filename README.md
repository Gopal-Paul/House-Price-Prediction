🏠 Predicting House Prices in India Using Regression
📌 Project Description

This project aims to predict house prices in India using regression analysis. The model is built using Python in a Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook environment. It analyzes key housing features such as area, BHK, location, and other parameters to estimate property prices accurately.

🎯 Problem Statement

House prices depend on multiple factors and vary widely across locations. This project uses machine learning regression techniques to learn patterns from historical data and predict prices for new housing entries.

🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains housing-related attributes such as:

Area (sq.ft)

Number of Bedrooms (BHK)

Location

Price (Target Variable)

Derived Feature: Price per square foot

Basic data preprocessing such as handling missing values and feature engineering has been performed.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

Scikit-learn – regression modeling

🧠 Machine Learning Model

Linear Regression

Feature scaling and train-test split are applied

Model performance evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

📊 Visualizations

Price vs Area

Price vs BHK

Location-wise price distribution

Actual vs Predicted prices

These visualizations help understand the relationship between features and house prices.
